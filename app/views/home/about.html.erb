<h3> Problem </h3>
<p> The cost of college and higher education has been rising dramatically over the past decade, but there has been little education on whether these costs are really worth it. High school students and their parents largely focus on academic rankings of colleges and amenities, and little attention is paid to the success of individual programs. This has led to many recent graduates leaving with large amounts of debt, and limited job prospects. </br>This problem is only being exacerbated by the growing costs of post-secondary education tuitions and enrolling students. With costs set to continue increasing in the foreseeable future there needs to be a focus away from just purely academic rankings, but instead focus on a critical review of individual programs available at colleges. Focusing on how programs can return value to the student will allow students to make the most affordable choice for post-secondary education.
